<h1 align="center">My Core Values</h1> 

 
In rupturing and grieving from losing my dad, I acknowledged my only fear was my inertia. This imbued me with the audacity to fly (quite literally). As I committed to personal development and lifelong learning, I solo traveled across Europe and Asia for five months. I self-advocated by pitching a flexible work style as I upscaled my skills in cybersecurity as a Fellow at The Knowledge House. 

My travels illuminated that my mindset accelerates my reality. When new technical concepts were initially difficult to grasp or time zones became exhausting, I meditated on the learning curve: all things are difficult until they are easy. I found a world of fulfillment from learning and gaining new connections and experiences.

I am grounded in knowing I am beyond capable. I aim to walk in my truth and be bold every precious day. In my ethos, I believe:


1. Direct and honest communication is foundational to productive, meaningful, and healthy relationships. Confronting issues directly is timely and solution based. I prioritize growth versus comfort. 

2. Kindness > niceness 
- Kindness is action-leaning and requires aligning with boundaries and principles that positively impact ourselves and our environments. Whereas niceness is about being polite, kindness is rooted in genuine care and empathy.
3. Embrace change and uncertainty 
- Change is an inevitable part of life, and those who embrace it proactively can adapt, evolve, and respond effectively to challenges and opportunities.
4. Reflection 
 - Through reflection, we can identify patterns and roots in our behavior and thought processes, and develop a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the world. Self-awareness is linked to improved decision-making. I value a cycle of doing, receiving feedback, reflecting, iterating, and doing for the sake of optimization and excellence. 
5. Creativity
 - Fueled by imagination, I budget time to tinker and play to drive innovation and solve problems in unique ways.
6. Abundance mindset
- I want to see a more interconnected world where knowledge and resources stream wide with ease. Approaching tasks with a sense of possibility cultivates resilience and radical care toward others. We can focus on opportunities rather than obstacles and approach challenges with a positive mindset. 
7. Recognize many types of intellect 
- Intelligence is more dimensional than being “book smart”. Emotional, spiritual, and logical intelligence manifest through wisdom, beauty, intuition, and more. For example, my grandmother may not be able to speak English, but she can muster wisdom that often stirs me. Challenging narrow definitions of intelligence that may be based on biased or outdated assumptions promotes a more expansive and inclusive view of human potential.
